#Protocol Specifications
This file contains detailed specifications for the three protocols, including the necessary labware 
and step-by-step instructions for each one.
Protocols uses specific coordinates for each labware. If you want to use the default coordinates, remove 
the line "labware.set_offset()" for each item.
It is also important to emphasize that the protocols are by default set to work with one plate per run. 
However, it is possible to use them for multiple plates if the line(s) commented with the style "#Write 
the amount of plates...." are modified in the .py file. In "Transfer_to_384_well_plate.py" protocol, you
can also specify the 384 well plate column from where you want to start using it (useful if the 384 well 
plate has already been used)


Protocol 1: "Cell_lysis.py"
- Summary
This protocol involves transferring 100 µL of solution from the first column of the reservoir into well 
A2 of the first 96-well plate, followed by transferring another 100 µL from the first column of the 
reservoir into well A3, continuing this process until well A11 is reached. Afterward, each well from A2 
to A11 is mixed twice, and the pipette tip is washed in well A12 of the reservoir between each transfer, 
to be discarded. If the protocol is performed for multiple plates, the robot first follows the procedure 
outlined above for the first plate, then applies the same steps to the second plate, using 100 µL from 
column A2 of the reservoir.
Therefore, a washing solution for the tips (e.g., bleach) should be manually prepared in column A12 of 
the reservoir. Additionally, if more than one plate is being processed, 10 mL of lysis solution should 
be placed in the respective column of the reservoir (one column per plate, starting from A1 for the 
first plate).

Protocol 2: "Drugs_combination_on_PCR_plate.py"
- Summary
This protocol requires manually placing the compounds into the first well of the first row (A2) and the 
first column (B1) of the PCR plate (at least 80 µL). Additionally, requires preparing an Eppendorf with 
DMSO in well A1 of the tuberack (1 mL). 
The protocol starts by adding DMSO into the first row and column, except for the wells where compounds 
were manually placed. The robot will transfer 50 µL from Eppendorf A1 in the tuberack to well A3 of the 
PCR plate, then from Eppendorf A1 to A4 in PCR plate, and so on. Afterward, it will fill the first column 
by aspirating again from Eppendorf A1 and transferring to C1, D1, and continuing until reaching G1. Then, 
serial dilutions of the compounds will be made in the first row (from A2 to A9) and the first column (from 
B1 to F1), transferring 50 µL each time. Finally, combinations will be made between the rows and columns; 
for this the robot will first distribute the content of column 1 along the rows (i.e., from B1 to B10, 
from B1 to B9, and so on), then it will distribute the content of the first row along each column (from 
A2 to G2, A2 to F2, etc).

Protocol 3: "Transferring_from_96_to_384-well_plate_and_substrate_addition.py"
- Summary
This protocol transfers solutions from a 96-well plate to a 384-well plate, mixing 5 times at each step. 
The robot first transfers 90 µL from B2 of the 96-well plate to A1 of the 384-well plate, then 90 µL from 
C2 to B1, and from D2 to C1, continuing this pattern until the entire 96-well plate is processed, 
excluding rows A and H, and column 1 of the 96-well plate.
The protocol also includes substrate distribution in the 384-well plate. It begins by adding 10 µL to the 
control wells, then continues filling the remaining wells in sequence (A1, B1, C1, etc.). Substrate is 
always drawn from an Eppendorf located in position A1 of the tuberack. At least 600 µL of substrate is 
required (10 µL per 60 wells).
